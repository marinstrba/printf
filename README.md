# ft_printf - A Custom Implementation of the printf Function

Description:
This project involves recreating the printf function from the standard C library. The goal is to understand the functionality and mechanics behind the versatile printf function, which is widely used for formatted output in C programming. This custom implementation, named ft_printf, replicates the core functionalities of the original printf function and can be extended to include additional features and specifications.

Features:

Implements the main functionalities of the standard printf function.
Handles various format specifiers such as %c, %s, %p, %d, %i, %u, %x, %X, and %%.
Manage flags, width, and precision for a more flexible output format.
User-friendly and documented code for easy understanding of the implementation.
